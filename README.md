## üíª CI / CD

-   Used [Vercel]("https://vercel.com") for deploying the NextJS app and was the CD provider
-   Vercel took care of building the app, and also act as a CI with complete build logs.
-   Used [Google Cloud Build]("https://cloud.google.com/build") to build the API and push the `Docker Image` to the [Google Cloud Container Registry]("https://cloud.google.com/container-registry")
-   The Docker image is then deployed on a GCP Cloud Instance and requests handled on `api-teams.ayushgoyal.dev`
-   These workflows gave me high confidence in building the application and spot and fix any issues quickly

[Agile Board](https://github.com/ayush6624/ms-engage/projects/1)
